I never did a hackaton before, I never been in southeast asia as well. 2 internet friends of mine currently in bangkok proposed me to join their team for the ethglobal bangkok hackaton. It's an web3/ethereum hackaton, with many sponsors and you can earn some prize by using the sponsor tech. The prize pool was 800 000$  

I quickly decided to join them, and i booked my flight to bangkok. 

I met my team one day before and we started brainstorming on ideas. We first looked for what was trending to have more change to win. So we first tried to find an idea the incorpore AI and AI agents.
But we didn't end up agreeing on something good. 

the hackaton started friday, we went there, and all sponsors were there and they was offering swag/merch so we went to see almost all of them. 
Talking with the teams gave us idea. 
My favorit merch piece of the venue was what the celo team offered, so i paid extra attention to them.

We kept brainstorming during few more hours, looking for an idea to build on CELO minipay app. We first stared with the idea of making a lending/borrowing protocol, but the idea involved into using a lending/borrowing to make a free lottery app. ( where people put their saving in a pool, and every week one random user is choosed and get all the yeild of the pool )


The building phase stared at 9PM on friday and ended 9AM on sunday. so we had 36h to build our product. 
I started to make some proposition for a full UI, so we had some more clear vision of what was needed and where we were going. 
All the sponsor were present in the hackaton so we could go to them and ask for feedback. So we went to see the celo team, and they were pretty responsive to our idea "I don't understand why it's not already existing on our marketplace" So we knew we were on a good path. 
On the friday evening we went to sleep not too late ( 3AM ) too keep strenght for the final rush the next day. 

The next day we made some good progress, thanks to the AI, i was able to brainstorm on differents UI styles really quick, and we quickly good a fonctional MVP. 

We went to go talk with the celo team to get their feedback and they gave us some good advice on the storytelling and who were our potential customers. Since we were building on minipay, (a mobile app that integrate the celo blockchain) our main customers would be people from the emergings markets. And minipay embed crypto but kinda hide it so the customers are not crypto fluent. So we had to make sure to adapt the wording for them. 

We branded the app as : a safe way to help people with gambling addiction because with our app they can gamble while saving money and without risking it. And I think that branding is what helped us alot to stand out. 


So the last day we had to make some presentations to the judge and sponsor teams. I got food poisoning turing the last hours of the hackaton so i couldn't assist my team on that task. But i think they did great since we won some prizes. 
We won : 
- Celo â€“ ðŸ“± Best responsive web app built for mobile - 1st place for $3500 in USDC
- The Graph â€“ ðŸ”® Best use of The Graph - 3rd place for $1500 in USDC

Now that the hackaton is over, we will still try to push our product to market. It's called https://tontine.money. The goal is not to make money from it but to get some exposure, and maybe it could open us some doors to be close to the celo team. 

It was my first hackaton and i loved it, I'm looking forward to go to the next one in taiwan.
