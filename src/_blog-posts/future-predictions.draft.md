## Why I'm Writing This

- To put my ideas down clearly
- To confront my predictions with myself
- Because I often discuss the future and make predictions with my family, so I want to put them in writing to be able to compare them with what actually happens later
- Because it makes for a good annual blog post
- I will try to write this post annually, with a retrospective on my past predictions and their accuracy each time

Let's get started

## Tech & Development

For the first topic, I'd like to talk about tech and development since these are the subjects I'm most familiar with as I deal with them every day. AI is taking an increasingly important place in my way of working, since 2021 with GitHub Copilot. But in 2024, it really accelerated, with tools like [cursor](https://www.cursor.com/). It's this year that I realized I won't be able to continue practicing my profession the same way for much longer and that I needed to start looking for ways to pivot a bit.

In my opinion, within 2 or 3 years:

- No-code won't take a bigger place because AI makes it simple to prototype apps super quickly, and more easily than with no-code
- Therefore, tools allowing non-technical people to create/prototype apps will continue to develop and take a bigger place
- There will be an equivalent of [v0](https://v0.dev/) for backend and infrastructure
- Experienced developers - seniors will have a big advantage over juniors because they will have been able to code before. Their work is increasingly becoming more about guiding LLMs. (My work is already heavily tending toward that)
- But I don't think the demand for developers will decrease right away

My opinion on 10 years:

- The profession of developer as we know it won't exist anymore. It will look more like a "product owner" / "product management" role: imagining products and following a vision
- Many jobs will be replaced by AI
- AI will consume more and more energy, and will take a significant share in global energy consumption. It's possible that tech companies will invest in nuclear energy research, cost optimization/simplification/reliability of fission reactors, as well as fusion research

## Web3 & Cryptocurrency

In the next 2 and 3 years, I think the web3 ecosystem will continue to grow, and new uses will emerge, but without mainstream usage in everyday life. However, Bitcoin will continue its growth against gold, and new countries will add it to their national reserves. Additionally, some large companies will start using Bitcoin for "inter-currency" transfers. However, the post-quantum question will continue to grow. People will start working on "post-quantum" cryptographic protocols.

I think we'll never reach a point where the majority will use custodial wallets for everyday use, as the risk of owning one's private key is too great. The risk could be losing the key or becoming vulnerable to personal physical attack.

There's still a lot of work to do to mature the ecosystem, prevent scams, and secure everyone's funds.

3-year predictions:

- Bitcoin over 200k
- USA adds Bitcoin to national treasury
- Prediction markets predict next elected French president 2 months ahead in 2027

## Health

In 4 years:

- Portable health devices like Apple Watch will become a norm in society as they get smaller and smaller

In 6 years:

- In the health field, I'm very optimistic that AI progress will improve the healthcare system significantly. Reducing the cost for medical advice and medical analysis will make healthcare faster and more affordable, especially for simpler medical advice or early diagnosis.
The combination of AI and medical imaging will enable earlier cancer detection

In 10 years:

- Progress on implants, robotics, and neural interfaces will allow people to have arm and leg prostheses that match natural capabilities and are even slightly better
- Neural interfaces are now a thing, you can consume content on them, causing severe addictions even worse than smartphones

## Cities

Cities will be less and less centered around cars. In cities, parking spots will drastically reduce, as full self-driving will allow cars to park somewhere else. I can see a future where urban transport happens without personal cars, but where a fleet of autonomous electric vehicles meets the needs for much less money. I also want to see a new offering between buses and personal cars, where a fleet of mini-vans (6/10 seats) travels through the city and optimizes routes by dropping each person at their home or right at their final destination.

The disappearance of combustion engines will greatly help improve air quality in large cities and reduce associated health problems.

In 4 years:

- Full self-driving allowed in the EU (yes it's slow but that's how the EU works)

In 6 years:

- Car sharing becomes more popular, or some people's personal cars will be able to drive other people around when unused

## Random Topics Predictions

- In 15 years, humanity will have a permanent lunar base
- In 10 years, a private company will land on Mars (rover or anything)
- If I don't die from an accident, I will live to at least 150 years old thanks to healthcare progress (I need to survive 30 years from now first though)

If war doesn't get in the way, the future looks exciting. And I can't wait to live it!
